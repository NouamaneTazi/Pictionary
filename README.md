## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


For [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.)

```
npm i -g nodemon
```
For ESlint

```
npm i -g eslint-cli
```
For deployment on heroku

```
npm i -g heroku
```
### Installing used Packages

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

We start by installing the Packages

```
npm run install
```

### Running the tests

In the console, after installing eslint globally, run :
```
eslint ./
```

### Running the website

For development, run these two commands in two different consoles :

>  To lunch the back-end
```
cd server && nodemon server
```
>  To lunch the front-end
```
cd client && npm start
```

For production : *(lunches both the back and the front)*

```
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

After logging in with your heroku account with `heroku login`, run in the console :

```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push heroku master
```
## App Usage
